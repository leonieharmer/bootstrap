			<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
			<h4>Bid Proposal Intern at CWind │ July - August 2018

				Completed full tender process on an international charter which was submitted within first week of internship. This involved strategically selecting a vessel based on the scope of the operation and future availability of vessels, and calculating mobilisation/demobilisation costs, daily vessel charges and exchange rate conversions as the project was due to take place in Rotterdam. Using these figures the price of the prospective project was calculated in line with the company’s revenue targets and the broker’s profit margin. 
				Created various databases such as a new finance model for vessel costing, personnel and equipment pricing which is now used by proposal engineers to calculate prices when submitting tenders, and a Bids Process database which is now implemented for every potential project opportunity.
				Completed full tender process for 15 year charter in Taiwan worth £23,000,000 which involved researching the new market for new opportunities, researching competitors activity, organising and leading meetings, presenting solutions, liaising with overseas offices and meeting short deadlines.
